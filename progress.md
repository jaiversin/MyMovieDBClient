# MovieDB App Progress

## Feature: Live Search

We have successfully implemented the live search functionality for the MovieDB app.

### Completed Tasks:

- [x] **Integrate `searchMovies`:** Created a new `searchMoviesPublisher` in `MovieService` to wrap the async function in a Combine `Future`.
- [x] **Update `MovieListViewModel`:** Refactored the view model's Combine pipeline to use `map` and `switchToLatest` for making live API search calls.
- [x] **Refine Search Logic:** The pipeline now debounces user input, handles empty queries by showing popular movies, and gracefully catches network errors.
- [x] **Display Search Results:** The `MovieListView` now correctly displays search results from the API.
- [x] **Bugfix:** Solved an issue where the search bar would disappear by moving the `.searchable()` modifier to a more stable parent view (`ScrollView`).

### Key Learnings:

- Using `map` and `switchToLatest` in Combine to achieve the "flatMapLatest" behavior.
- Wrapping an `async/await` function in a `Future` publisher.
- The importance of attaching SwiftUI modifiers like `.searchable()` to stable parent views.

## Feature: Pagination and Advanced Caching

Implemented infinite scrolling for the popular movies list with a robust, multi-layered caching strategy.

### Completed Tasks:

- [x] **Pagination (Infinite Scroll):** The popular movies list now fetches new pages automatically as the user scrolls down.
- [x] **Pull-to-Refresh:** Users can pull down on the list to force a refresh of the latest movies from the network.
- [x] **In-Memory Caching:** Implemented a generic `CacheStore` using `NSCache` to cache API responses for both popular movies and search results.
- [x] **Advanced Cache Invalidation:** Solved a critical data consistency issue by creating a specialized `PaginatedCacheStore` that can invalidate all paginated results at once during a refresh, without affecting the search cache.

### Key Learnings:

- Managing pagination state (current page, loading status) within a ViewModel.
- Using `.onAppear` on a list item to trigger fetching the next page.
- Implementing pull-to-refresh with SwiftUI's `.refreshable` modifier.
- The importance of cache invalidation strategies (`forceRefresh` flag).
- Designing and implementing scoped caches to prevent side effects and ensure data consistency.
