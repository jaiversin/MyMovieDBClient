# MovieDB App Progress

## Current Focus: Search Feature

We have successfully implemented the live search functionality for the MovieDB app.

### Completed Tasks:

- [x] **Integrate `searchMovies`:** Created a new `searchMoviesPublisher` in `MovieService` to wrap the async function in a Combine `Future`.
- [x] **Update `MovieListViewModel`:** Refactored the view model's Combine pipeline to use `map` and `switchToLatest` for making live API search calls.
- [x] **Refine Search Logic:** The pipeline now debounces user input, handles empty queries by showing popular movies, and gracefully catches network errors.
- [x] **Display Search Results:** The `MovieListView` now correctly displays search results from the API.
- [x] **Bugfix:** Solved an issue where the search bar would disappear by moving the `.searchable()` modifier to a more stable parent view (`ScrollView`).

### Key Learnings:

- Using `map` and `switchToLatest` in Combine to achieve the "flatMapLatest" behavior for handling live search requests.
- Wrapping an `async/await` function in a `Future` publisher to integrate it with a Combine pipeline.
- The importance of attaching SwiftUI modifiers like `.searchable()` to stable parent views to avoid state-related UI bugs.
